#vec2web

vec2web is a program to convert DXF files to various formats.  This is a fork of the code in order to fix a few issues for my own purposes and bring it up to date to allow for compilation on semi-modern systems.  Hopefully eventually it will involve updating to QT4 and overhauling much of it, but that is in the distant future.

## Dependencies
As of right now vec2web itself depends only on qt3 and the libraries included here and the scripts to convert to pdf also add a dependency of ps2pdf which is installed on most unix systems I believe.

## Future Plans
I intend to update this to Qt4 ASAP.  In fact I am hoping it won't need much work to do so, but I don't have time to do it right at this moment.  Also more flexibility in the system is required, to allow for rendering in different locations on the page, and to automatically scale down renders if needed.  And of course fix some hardcoded assumptions like the location of fonts and packages.
