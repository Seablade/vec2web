What is vec2web ? 
=================

vec2web is a small tool to convert vector drawings (currently DXF)
to graphics which can be used on the web (currently PNG). However, 
vec2web can also convert DXF drawings to PS (post script) and WBMP
(wireless bitmap) or display them in an X11 or Windows window.
